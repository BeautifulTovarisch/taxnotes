## Filing Requirements

It is generally a good idea to file even if you don't strictly meet the requirements for record-keeping purposes and to receive a refund of any withheld tax. For most taxpayers, the [[Types of Income#Gross Income]] requirements based on [[Filing Status]] are most pertinent, but certain [[Filing Requirements and Due Dates#Special Conditions]] require filing irrespective of income. 

### Income Requirements

|Filing Status     |Age     |Income |
|----------------- |--------|-------|
|S|< 65|$14,600|
||> 65|$16,550|
|MFJ|< 65 (both)|$29,200|
||< 65 (one)|$30,750|
||< 65|$14,600|
|MFS|any|$5|
|QSS|< 65|$29,200|
||< 65|$30,750|

> The income requirements are generally based on the standard deduction, since taking that deduction would result in $0 tax owed regardless.
