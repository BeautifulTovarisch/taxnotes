Filing status affects the standard deduction and filing requirements. In general the status are ranked from most favorable to least as follows:

- Married Filing Jointly/Qualified Surviving Spouse
- Head of Household
- Single
- Married Filing Separately

## Residency

US citizens and **resident alien** are taxed on their **worldwide income**. Non-resident aliens are only taxed on their **US income**.

**Resident aliens** satisfy at least one of:
	- Green Card
	- Substantial Presence

Substantial presence is defined as living in the United States for ==31 days== during current tax year **and** ==183 days== in the past three tax years. The number of days considered for the substantial presence test is given by:

$$
\text{total days} = \text{days}_{n} 
	+ \frac 1 3 \text{days}_{n-1}
	+ \frac 1 6 \text{days}_{n-2}
$$

where $n$ is the current tax year.

## Married Filing Jointly

Must be married on or before Dec 31st

- Even if spouse died
- Both spouses must agree to file jointly
- Report combined income and expenses (one taxpayer)

## Qualified Surviving Spouse

- Widow with [[Dependents#Qualifying Child]]
- Same tax treatment as **MFJ**
- Can file as MFJ/MFS in year of death
- Eligible for two tax years following the year of death

In addition, there are special eligibility rules for QSS. The taxpayer must have:

- Been entitled to file jointly with the decedent
- Must not have remarried before the end of the tax year
- Has a qualifying child or stepchild (not foster child) and could claim them except:
	- The gross income test was not met
	- The joint return test was not met
	- The taxpayer could be claimed as a dependent on someone else's return
- Had a qualifying child living in their home **all year**
- Paid more than half the cost of keeping up the home

> Note the exceptions for being able to claim the qualifying child on the return

## Head of Household

- If the taxpayer is unmarried or considered unmarried (see below)
- A [[Dependents#Qualifying Person]] lives with the taxpayer in the home for >50% of the year
	- Not counting **temporary absences**
	- Dependent parents don't have to live with the taxpayer
- Better tax treatment than MFS or Single

> NOTE: If legally married, but considered unmarried, the qualifying dependent must be a **child**

### Considered Unmarried

This condition is part of the eligibility requirements of the Head of Household status. If the taxpayer is legally married, but meets these criteria, they are considered "unmarried" for tax purposes.

- Separate tax return (cannot file jointly)
- Paid >50% of the cost of keeping up the home
	- repairs, rent/mortgage, utilities, food **eaten in home**, homeowner's insurance, real estate tax, insurance
	- **not** dependent care or support (this is handled separately)
- Spouse did not live in the home for the past ==6 months== including **temporary absences** (school or work travel etc.)
- Was the main home for the child, stepchild, or foster child for >50% of the year
- Must be _able_ to claim the child as a dependent, even if they are not
	- e.g due to tiebreaker rules

## Single

Not married before end of tax year. Marital status on Dec 31st determines the status for the **entire year**.

- Including divorce, widow, or legal separation
- May qualify for QSS or HOH 

## Married Filing Separately

If a taxpayer files separately from their spouse, they are treated as their own taxpayer, but in general receive the worse tax treatment. There are cases in which it makes sense to file separately, however:

- If a spouse is taking an aggressive or illegal tax position
- Pending divorce or marital issues
- Favorable rates on student loans
- Personal finance reasons

If filing separately:

- Each spouse is liable only for their own return
- **Cannot** elect to file as Single
- **Can** amend to file as **MFJ**
