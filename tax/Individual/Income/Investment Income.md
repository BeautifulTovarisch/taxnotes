Investment income is divided into **active** and **passive** income. When considering expenses, only those **of the same type** may be deducted against the corresponding income.

## Active Income

Active income is from an activity in which the taxpayer **materially participates**. In other words, the taxpayer is involved in the day-to-day operations of the business on a regular, continuous, and substantial basis.

Portfolio income is also considered active income for the purposes of [[Deductions]] .

## Passive Income

Income from an activity in which the taxpayer does not materially participate, such as:

- A silent partner
- Rental income
