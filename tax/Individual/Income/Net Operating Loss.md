A Net Operating Loss occurs when losses (such as from business, casualty and theft, etc.) exceed income for a given tax year. The following are **not included** when computing NOL:

- Capital losses in excess of capital gains (this is handled separately)
-  Section 1202 exclusion
- Nonbusiness deductions exceeding nonbusiness income
- NOL carryover
- [[Qualified Business Income]] deduction
- Domestic production activities deduction

- Net Operating Loss generated after ==2020== **cannot** be carried back to previous years
- NOL can be carried forward indefinitely (until death)
- Can only be used to offset ==80%== of taxable income without respect to any NOL carryforward, QBID, and global intangible low-taxed income deduction
- Report NOL as a negative amount on [[Schedules#Schedule 1]]
