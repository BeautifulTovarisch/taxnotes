**All** non-exempt income in the form of wages, goods, property and services. Income is divided into **taxable** and **non-taxable** income. Any income that is not explicitly non-taxable is **automatically** considered taxable.

> With some exceptions, individuals must use the **cash basis** of accounting when considering which year's tax return received income applies to.
