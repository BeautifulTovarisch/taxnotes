Failing to file or pay tax can result in penalties **if there is tax owed**.

## Failure to File

Failing to _file_ by the due date including extensions incurs a penalty:

- 5% per month up to 25%
- 15% per month up to 75% if fraud is involved
- > 60 days late, the **minimum** penalty is the lesser of 100% of underpayment or the amount computed (see calculation below).

> Penalties start accruing on the **original due date**

The penalty is computed as follows:

$$
\begin{align}
	\text{penalty} &= \text{tax owed} \\
	&- \text{tax paid on time} \\
	&- \text{refundable credits} \\
	&* \text{5\% per month up to 25\%}
\end{align}
$$

## Failure to Pay

Failing to _pay_ tax by the due date

- 0.05% per month up to 25%
- No penalty if >= 90% balance paid by the time of filing

> The failure to file penalty is reduced by failure to pay
